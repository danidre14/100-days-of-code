# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Danidre

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 8th, Saturday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1: January 8th, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Maxed out my stats on freeCodeCamp's Learn To Code RPG in preparation for the [2022 Resolution](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/2022-become-a-dev-new-years-resolution-challenge/).

**Thoughts**: Technically I did not code, but I mentally prepared myself and read about code, which counts in my book.

### R1D2: January 9th, Sunday
**Today's Progress**: Learned bash by completing the bash tutorial from freeCodeCamp's Relational Database Certification, as well as created a figma mockup for my game engine editor's landing page and fixed bugs in the flevar editor.

**Thoughts**: Although it is 100DaysOfCode, and the FAQ considered tutorials out of "proper" coding logs, I want to include it daily, since my plan is to complete the 300 hour database certification within the 100 days of code, and all other programming/code secondary. As for the figma mockup, I duplicated a general theme found on figma and went about adding my own resources. It'll be a while of contemplating what stack I should use to actually create it. I want to host it on https://flevar.com soon. As for the FlevaR Editor bug fixes, I discovered those bugs during a [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/toast-2021/rate/1325405) last year, so I went about finding the causes and fixing the bugs today. I want to host the editor on `https://editor.flevar.com` soon. _(Currently it's on `flevar.com`)_

### R1D3: January 11th, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Started working on the landing page for the FlevaR Editor

**Thoughts**: I've decided to use Express and TailwindCSS for it. I planned on one hour alone but spent all day trying to figure out why some styles would not show up when building. Turns out I needed to remove the `mode: "jit"` flag and it would show up. :)
