## Log

### R1D1: January 8th, Saturday
**Today's Progress**: Maxed out my stats on freeCodeCamp's Learn To Code RPG in preparation for the [2022 Resolution](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/2022-become-a-dev-new-years-resolution-challenge/).

**Thoughts**: Technically I did not code, but I mentally prepared myself and read about code, which counts in my book.
